# Linux filesystem

# Linux os
  In order to have a working computer, we need 3 things atleast
    1. Hardware
    2. Software
    3. Kernel --> a software that enables the os software to communicate with the underlyning hardware

    Linux ia a software os && a kernel software
  --> It is software that can be used to manage other systems hardware & their resources 
    example --> linux kernel enables android software to communicate with any samsung, or apple or nokie cell phone
  --> It is an open source operating system
  --> Does not need a linense to use or resale it, not paid for


  # What are the two ways to use the linux os
    --> GUI __> Graphical user interface
      ? Why do you open a terminal 
    --> CLI --> command line interface == shell prompt == terminal
      One main advantage of the cli --> it provides more functionality, supports script execution:

  # The most important skill to learn is the ability to nagivate the file system
    There are two ways to navigate the file system
      - Absolute file path ==> it is the true path that starts from the user home directory ~/
      - Relative file path ==> it is the path that starts from the current working directory ./
        . ==> current
        .. ==> previous

        * GUI --> folder
        * CLI --> directory

  # Everything in the linux filesystem is files
    Even the directories are also files

      Linux Directory Structure
      / == root
        /bin 
        /etc
        /home
          /user1
          /user2
          /user3
        /opt
        /data
        /usr
        /var
        /tmp --> temporary files are stored here, && everyone has access to write here
        /lib --> essential shared libraries && kernel modules are stored
        /usr/bin --> 


Assignment--> What does each directory do in the filesystem 
          --> Why is it there
