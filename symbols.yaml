docker â€“version
docker pull
docker run
docker ps -- list containers running on our local machine
docker ps -a -- list containers running and stopped on our local machine
docker exec -- execute commands on containers
docker stop -- to gracefully stop a container
docker kill --  to immediately stop a container, without giving it the chance to gracefully shutdown
docker login -- login to the docker registry
docker push
docker images -- list docker images
docker rm -- remove docker conatiners
docker rmi -- remove docker images
docker build -- build a docker images

! What we will be using

  docker run
  docker ps -- list containers running on our local machine
  docker ps -a -- list containers running and stopped on our local machine
  docker exec -- execute commands on containers
  docker stop -- to gracefully stop a container
  docker kill --  to immediately stop a container, without giving it the chance to gracefully shutdown

# list docker containers
docker ps

# list all containers, running or not
docker ps -a

# enter a docker container
$ docker exec -it container id bash
docker exec -it c6bafa4e60c3 bash


pwd
  print working directory
  present working directory

Navigate the file system:

  Absolute file path --> it is the path relative to the users home dir
  Relative file path --> it is the path from the pwd

Procols: 
DNS: The Domain Name System, translates human readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0. 2.44).

  Responsible for resolving domain names names to ip address
  Domain name --human readable
  Ip address -- both human and machine readable
  human types amazon.com =  DNS = 192.0. 2.44
              http://locahost DNS  http://127.0.0.1
  http://locahost = http://127.0.0.1
